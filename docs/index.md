# Welcome!

This is the 
externally accessible 
web-page for
[COMSM0042: Advanced Cryptology](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?unitCode=COMSM0042),
a unit operated by the 
[School of Computer Science](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/schools/computer-science),
[University of Bristol (UoB)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk).
Quoting the catalogue entry, the remit of this unit can be summarised as follows:

{: .notice--info}
 <div markdown='block' style='font-style: italic'>
[t]his unit builds on the foundations of confidentiality and authenticity set down in COMS30023 Cryptology, and deals with more advanced topics, specific to modern cryptographic research. Topics will range from foundational questions to more practical ones.  The syllabus may include aspects of:

 <ul><li>Foundations and primitives: pseudo-random generators, functions and permutations, hard-core bits; hash function preimage and collision resistance.
    </li>
     <li>Elliptic-curve Cryptography: ECDH, ECDSA, Curve25519, pairings.
    </li>
     <li>Post-Quantum Cryptography: lattices, codes, multivariate, hash-based, isogenies, and MPC-in-the-Head.
    </li>
     <li>Interactive 2 Party Protocols: Security models and applications of commitment schemes and sigma protocols (zero-knowledge).
    </li>
     <li>Digital signatures: One-time signatures, signatures based on sigma protocols (Fiat-Shamir heuristic), and blind signatures.
    </li>
     <li>Multi-party primitives, protocols, and use cases: Shamir secret sharing, generic multi-party computation; e-cash and e-voting; algorithmic side-channel countermeasures.
    </li>
</ul>

Note that

- Our somewhat complex curriculum structure means this unit is divided into
  a          *teaching*   unit
  [COMSM0042](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?unitCode=COMSM0042),
  plus
  associated *assessment* units
  [COMSM0153](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?unitCode=COMSM0153) (as a major option)
  and
  [COMSM0158](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?unitCode=COMSM0158) (as a minor option):
  although 
  COMSM0042
  is usually a valid catch-all, in certain contexts care is needed re. use of the correct unit code.
- An associated 
  [GitHub](https://github.com/)-based [repo.](https://github.com/cs-uob/COMSM0042)
  houses the source code for this web-page, plus various other
  resources which might be useful.
- Although the goal is to provide
  "[Blackboard](https://www.blackboard.com)-free"
  access to as much 
   *static* content 
  as possible, selected internal-facing
  *dynamic* content 
  is only accessible via the associated
  [Blackboard web-page](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk):
  important examples include
  any unit announcements,
  the unit forum,
  and
  any submission points, marks, and feedback related to assessment.
